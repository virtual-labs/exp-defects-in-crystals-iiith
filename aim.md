### Aim of the experiment

The aim of this experiment is to understand the theory behind reciprocal lattices, primarily about construction of these reciprocal lattices using the reciprocal vectors. By the end of the experiment, the user is expected to be able to find the reciprocal vectors for a given lattice and hence build the reciprocal lattice for a given lattice.
